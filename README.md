#Mini Data Warehouse project (Python + PostgreSQL)

This project is a **mini data warehouse** built with **Python** and **PostgreSQL**.  
The goal is to practice building an **ETL pipeline**: from a single external dataset, split into normalized tables (`customers`, `products`, `orders`, `order_items`), loaded into PostgreSQL staging, transformed into a **star schema**, and queried for basic business KPIs.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
- Learn to build an **end-to-end ETL pipeline** with Python and SQL  
- Practice loading and transforming data in **PostgreSQL**  
- Design a simple **star schema** (dimensions + fact)  
- Create basic **analytical views** (monthly sales, AOV, customer metrics)  
- Showcase a clean and reproducible **data engineering project** on GitHub
